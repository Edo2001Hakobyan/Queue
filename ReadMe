Queue in c++.
A queue is a data structure that allows you to insert elements at the back and remove elements from the front. It follows the FIFO (First-In-First-Out) principle.

Inserting elements.
To insert an element into the queue, you can use the push() method.

Removing elements.
To remove the element at the front of the queue, you can use the pop() method.
This removes the element at the front of the queue. Note that you cannot use the pop() method on an empty queue.

Accessing elements.
To access the element at the front of the queue without removing it, you can use the get_front() method.

Checking if the Queue is Empty.
To check if the queue is empty, you can use the is_empty() method.

Usage Makefile. 
To use the Makefile to build and compile your C++ program, navigate to the directory containing the Makefile in a terminal and enter the command make. This will build the default target, which is usuall the main executable file. You can also use the following commands:
1.make clean: Remove all files generated by the build process. 
2.make run: Run the program to the system, if specified in the Makefile.
